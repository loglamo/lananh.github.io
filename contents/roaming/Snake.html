When i was 11 years old, i was followed and beaten by a dog. I was really scared of dogs from that. If i meet small dogs, it is alright for me. If i meet big dogs, i even can not take a step.:)). Everytime my friends invite me to visit their house, the first question i give them "do you have any dog? Are they good? " 
When i was 15 years old, i saw a snake. Exactly, the holly fucking that snake was next to my feets. It was far apart my feet about 3cm. You can never understand that fear. However, at that age, i was really ..., i went out step by step in a normal way as i see nothing. I told my mother. My mother gave me a big stick to hit that snake. At one time, the snake moved, it was not at the same place. One more time, i saw it next to me. Why it always next to me. Did it like me? I hit it with a stick as i never hit anyone before, but it was gone.
